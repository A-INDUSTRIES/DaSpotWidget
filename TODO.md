# TODO

* #### Create proper config system
  * Fix width vs Self resizing
  * Player config (ability to choose default player)
  * Restrict player detection, ie only use default chosen?
  * Not moving vs Self moving
  * Font config?
  * Theme config?

* #### Detect currently playing player (if many, select default from config)

* #### Clean temporary files on close

* #### Proper support for other wm than hyprland 
    (iced's implementation might not work for some wm, doesn't for hyprland as far as i know)

* #### Merge my [other project using playerctl](https://github.com/A-INDUSTRIES/PlayerCtlWaybar) with this one (ie add waybar functionnality)

* #### And more?
